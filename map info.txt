1. truly random map:


qatar



3. star map with dense center:


densestar

half-ish points close to center < 50, half points far from center > 100


4. cone map with start on point


singlecone

1 center at 0 0, 1 cluster at 100 0, points in cluster < 40 dist from cluster center


5. cone map with start in middle, multiple cones


multicone

1 center at 0 0, 4 clusters at 100 0, -100 0, 0 100 and 0 -100, points in cluster are < 40 dist from cluster center

6. dense center with few outliers


densecenter

1-200 points close to center < 50, 201-250 points at a minimum distance of > 150
